                  <h4>Privacy Policy:</h4>
                  <p>team:up's mission is to connect the world’s professionals to allow them to be more productive and successful. Our registered users (“Members”) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and find business and career opportunities. Content on some of our services is also visible to unregistered viewers (“Visitors”). We believe that our services allow our Members to effectively compete and achieve their full career potential. The cornerstone of our business is to focus on our Members first.</p>
                  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to team:up.com and the team:up mobile application, SlideShare.net and SlideShare mobile app (“SlideShare”), Pulse.me and Pulse mobile app (“Pulse”), team:up platform technology (such as “Share on team:up” plugins for publishers), the advertising platform created by Bizo Inc. (and its successor products) and all other team:up websites, apps, developer platforms and other products and services (collectively the “Services”). We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Service, or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use our Services. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use our Services after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>
                  <p>To create an account on team:up, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password and agree to our User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, which governs how we treat your information. You may provide additional information during the registration flow (for example, your postal code, job title, and company) to help you build your profile and to provide you more customized services (for example: language-specific profile pages, updates, content, more relevant ads and career opportunities). You understand that, by creating an account, we and others will be able to identify you by your team:up profile. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain additional services.
                    We also provide the option to register for a SlideShare account, for which you must provide at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. We no longer provide the option to register for a separate Pulse account, but you may continue to use your existing Pulse account if you already have one.</p>
                    <p>After you create an account (other than the distinct SlideShare and Pulse accounts), you may choose to provide additional information on your team:up profile, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. Subject to the settings you choose, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from our Services by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters and business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off of our Services.
                      On team:up, you can choose what personal information you provide in addition to the information required for registration as noted above. Most of your team:up profile, as well as all content that you post on team:up, is publicly displayed (with the exceptions provided in the SlideShare account settings), so please do not provide personal information you would not want to be public. We may use and share information you provide in a SlideShare profile and/or Pulse account in the same manner as the information provided in a team:up profile, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement.</p>
